Object detection is breaking into a wide range of industries, with use cases ranging from personal security to automated vehicle safety. While object detection
techniques have improved massively over the past decade, most state of the art detectors rely on pre-defined anchor boxes and 2-stage region proposal networks. In this project, we try to implement an anchor-free, region proposal-free detector which makes use of multi-level feature pyramid network for greater localization
and classification accuracy. We compare this model to an anchor-based single FPN baseline that we implemented for the mid-term report.
